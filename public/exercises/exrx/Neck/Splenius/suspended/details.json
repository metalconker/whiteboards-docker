"comments": "This exercise can be performed with belt looped on TRX style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings. Throughout movement, keep body straight and maintain tightgrip on belt against forehead. Use neck to pull belt rather than allowing hand to assist. Woven cotton or cloth belts tend to slip less, particularly on bald head. If belt slips from head, place small towel between belt and head. Belts not made specifically for weight training may cause injury if they fail under load in which they were not designed. Easier Begin with upright position at top position so neck structures have an opportunity to adapt. Standard neck exercises with light weights can also be less intense.
