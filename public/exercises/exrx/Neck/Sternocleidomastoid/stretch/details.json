    "comments": "Neck retraction primarily consists of Cervical Flexion (spine) accompanied by subtle Thoracic Flexion (spine) and Neck Flexion (atlantooccipital joint). Cervical spine has natural lordotic curvature (see diagram of spine). Much of the retraction motion is actually flattening or slight reversing the normal lordosis. The deep neck flexors perform majority of this movement. Slight neck Flexion at the atlantooccipital joint also occurs to maintain forward head positioning. Also see similar exercise Lying Neck Retraction Isometric.",
