"utility": "Basic or Auxiliary",

"force": "Pull",
"preparation": "Stand near low smith bar. Bend knees and bend over bar with back straight. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip. Disengage bar by rotating bar back.",
"execution": "Keeping upper arm perpendicular to torso, pull bar up toward upper chest until upper arms are just beyond parallel to floor. Return and repeat.",
"comments": "If upper arm travels closer than perpendicular to trunk, latissimus dorsi becomes involved. Elbows should be raised directly lateral to shoulders. Positioning torso at 45 is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. Keep torso bent over approximately horizontal. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. If low back is rounded due to poor form, slowly lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. Much lighter resistance is required as Smith Bentover Row.
