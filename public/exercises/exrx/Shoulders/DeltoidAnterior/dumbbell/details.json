"preparation": "Stand with two dumbbells position in front of shoulders, palms facing body and elbows under wrists.",
"execution": "Initiate movement by bringing elbows out to sides. Continue to raise elbows outward while pressing dumbbells overhead until arms are straight. Lower to front of shoulders in opposite pattern and repeat.",
"comments": "Movement should emphasize shoulder abduction while minimizing forearm pronation as this exercise attempts to combine lateral raise like motion with shoulder press. Lean forward slightly when lifting Dumbbells.",
