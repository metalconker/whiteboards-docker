"utility": "Auxiliary",
"mechanics": "Isolated",
"force": "Pull",
"preparation": "Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until arms are extended forward and straight. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body reclines back behind suspension handles. Position body and legs straight at desired angle hanging from handles with arms straight and palms angled inward.",
"execution": "Raise arms upward and outward in shape of a Y while keeping arms straight. Return and lower body back in opposite motion until arms are extended straight forward in original position. Repeat.",
"comments": "At higher angles, feet can be placed flat on floor. When angled further back, only heels may contact forefeet floor with forefeet raising upward. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright. This exercise can be performed on TRX style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings. Easier Resistance is least when body is positioned upright at top of exercise. Movement can be made easier with staggered foot position by placing one foot slightly back. Harder This movement can be made more challenging by placing feet more forward, thereby angling body back at initiation of movement. In which case, stance can be on heels with forefeet pointing upward. See Gravity Vector for greater understanding of how body angle influences resistance.",
