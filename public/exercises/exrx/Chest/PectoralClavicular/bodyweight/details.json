Lower elevations will target sternal head of pectoralis major but still involve clavicular head of pectoralis major as synergist. Easier Resistance can be reduced by using lower elevation, placing bent knees on stability bar, or performing standard pushup. Decline Pushup on stability ballPushup Harder Placing feet on higher elevation will make this exercise more challenging. If feet are not elevated to high, training partner can secure weight on back. Also consider plyo pushups or front deltoid bodyweight exercise that also involves upper chest. Clap Pushup (on ball)Pike Press",

"comments": "Pike Pushup (for upper chest) differs from Pike Press (for front delts) in that, feet are further away from hands so body is less inverted in lowest position. Easier Resistance can be reduced by performing exercise on bench or apparatus with hands positioned higher than feet. Keep in mind, this specialized movement may not be necessary since upper chest can be utilized somewhat during pushup movements.
