"utility": "Basic",

"force": "Push",
"preparation": "Stand on bench or elevation between parallel bars. Mount wide dip bar with oblique grip (bar diagonal under palm), arms straight with shoulders above hands. Bend knees and hips slightly and place forefoot on bench or elevation below.",
"execution": "Lower body by bending arms, allowing elbows to flare out to sides. If necessary, use minimal assistance of lower body to control descent, allowing knees and hips to bend, keeping forefeet in contact with bench or elevation. When slight stretch is felt in chest or shoulders, push body up until arms are straight and repeat, again with minimal assistance from legs.",
"comments": "If lower body is used for assistance, Hip and Knee Extensors muscles are utilized. Hips are bent more and body leans forward more, as compared to Selfassisted Triceps Dip. Easier Resistance can be reduced by pushing with legs more or using assisted machine. Machine Assisted Harder Standard Chest Dips can be performed for greater challenge. Chest Dip",
