"force": "Push",
"preparation": "Stand on bench or elevation between parallel bars. Mount shoulder width dip bar, arms straight with shoulders above hands. Bend knees and place toes on bench or elevation behind and below body.",
"execution": "Lower body by bending arms back. If necessary, use minimal assistance of lower body to control descent, allowing knees to bend, keeping toes in contact with bench or elevation. When slight stretch is felt in chest or shoulders push body up until arms are straight. Repeat with minimal assistance from legs.",
"comments": "If lower body is used for assistance, Quadriceps are utilized. Hips are kept straighter and body more upright, as compared to Assisted Chest Dip. Easier Resistance can be reduced by pushing with legs more or using assisted machine. Machine Assisted Harder Standard Triceps Dips can be performed for greater challenge. Triceps Dip",
