    "execution": "Lower in straight line toward neck while keeping elbows relatively high and bending them out to sides, approximately 45 from midline of body. Flex wrists slightly as bar is lowered as to keep weight of bar on base of palms. Pause when forearms mak e solid contact with biceps. Push barbell back up until arms are straight. Repeat.",
    "comments": "Movement is hybrid between Bench Press and Triceps Extension. A false grip or standard thumb opposing grip can be taken, approximately 16 (40 cm) apart for men. Bar is brought downward anywhere between chin and upper chest. As to minimize shoulder involvement, keep elbows up, allowing elbow to fold upon itself. Range of motion is determined by muscle mass of forearm and biceps. After mastering form and gradually progressing in resistance, push barbell upward more rapidly for greater power development. Exercise was created by 4 time world bench press champion JohnMark Blakely. However, exercises name was reportedly coined by Louie Simmons and George Halbert when Blakely was training at Westside Barbell. Also known as Blakely Press.",
