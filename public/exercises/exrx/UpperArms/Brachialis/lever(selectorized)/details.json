Long head (lateral head) of biceps brachii is activated significantly more than short head (medial head) of biceps brachii since short head enters into active insufficiency as it continues to contract. Long head of Triceps Brachii is only significant activated as antagonist stabilizer when it approaches passive insufficiency as elbow nears full flexion.
