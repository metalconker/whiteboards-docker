"execution": "Extend spine until hyperextended. Return and repeat.",
"comments": "To avoid hip movement, push hips back into seat by pushing feet into platform throughout exercise. Position foot platform, so small space remains between edge of seat and back of lower thigh. Use seat belt if it becomes difficult to stabilize hips. See Low Back Debate. Also see exercises on old Nautilus Machineand MedEx Low Back Machine.",

"comments": "Those with limited hip flexor flexibility may need to stop before full extension on this particular type of apparatus (fulcrum near hip). Full range of motion will vary from person to person. Many machines may not sufficiently stabilize hips or their fulcrum may be near hips axis. In which case, synergists muscles become primary movers and erector spinae becomes stabilizer (Graves JE, et. al. 1994). See alternative back extension machines (Nautilus and MedX) with hip stabilization.",
