"preparation": "Stand between two very low pulleys with shoulder width or narrower stance. Squat down and grasp stirrup attachments to each side. Stand upright with arms straight down to sides.",
"execution": "Bow forward by bending hips. Bend knees slightly during descent and keep waist straight, flexing low back at bottom. With knees slightly bent, raise torso by extending at waist, then hips, gradually extending knees until standing upright. Pull shoulders back slightly if rounded. Repeat.",
"comments": "Lower back may bend slightly during hip flexion phase. Erector Spinae is exercised isometrically if low back does articulate as with Straight Back Stiff Leg Deadlift (targeting Glutes). Begin with light weight and add additional weight gradually to allow adequate adaptation. Throughout lift, keep arms straight. Knee can be kept bent throughout movement. Do not stand behind pulleys. Do not pause or bounce at bottom of lift. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch throughout hamstrings and back When finished with set, dismount by lowering weight with knees bent and low back straight. Full range of motion will vary from person to person. Those with less flexibility may have to bend knees more or they may not even need to stand on platform. See Dangerous Exercise Essay.
