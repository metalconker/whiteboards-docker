"execution": "Raise body upward by straightening body in straight line. Hold position.",
"comments": "Muscles are exercised isometrically. Exercise can also be performed with straight supporting arms in pushup stance. Also see Spot Reduction Myth. Easier Movement can be made easier angling body up on elevated platform or bench. Exercise can also be performed on bent knees instead of forefeet. Harder Exercise could be made more challenging with added weight (eg sandbags, partner) on hips or low back, although it is rarely performed in that manner. Raising one foot up off floor can also make holding this position more difficult. Stability Ball Rollout requires more shoulder strength.",

"name": "Stability Ball Rollout",
"utility": "Auxiliary",
"mechanics": "Isolated",
"force": "Push",
"preparation": "Kneel on floor or mat facing stability ball within arms reach. Straighten hips with subtle bend. Also straighten arms with slight bend, down in front of body. Place fists side by side on upper side of ball closest to hips.",
"execution": "Lean forward and roll ridged arms out over ball. Roll forward as far as possible. Raise body back up by pulling arms back until kneeling upright in original position. Repeat.",
"comments": "Try to keep elbows nearly straight throughout exercise. Also known as Stability Ball Kneeling Rollout. Target muscle, Rectus Abdominis practically contracts isometrically since only a small degree of waist flexion occurs under resistance and, with the assistance of the External Oblique, act to stabilize spine. See target muscle of rollout question. Also see Spot Reduction Myth and Lower Ab Myth. Easier Movement can be made slightly easier by performing exercise on a larger ball. Descending only part way down is much easier and can be performed in this way to progress into exercise. For greater stability, arms can be placed slightly further apart and legs can be positioned further apart. Front Plank can be performed to work abdominals in similar manner until greater strength can be developed through shoulders required to execute this exercise. Harder Make sure to roll out until shoulder is fully extended through full range of motion. Exercise can be made slightly more challenging by using smaller stability ball or kneeling on slightly elevated platform, keeping exercise ball on floor. To challenge stability, arms andor legs can be placed closer together.",
