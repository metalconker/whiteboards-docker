"preparation": "Sit on floor facing suspension trainer loops in low position. Grasp bottom of loops, then lay supine. Raise legs and place heels in loops with soles contacting handles. Lie down supine on mat so knees and hips are bent with suspension straps hanging vertical. Place arms off to sides.",
"execution": "Raise hips up by extending hips until fully extended. Lower hips until hips and back make contact with mat. Repeat.",
"comments": "This exercise can be performed on TRX style suspension trainer. See Suspended Supine Feet MountDismount. Hamstring enters active insufficiency as hip is raised since knee is flexed and hip does not flex beyond 90 degrees. However, it is used more to stabilize knees in fixed flexed position. Dorsal flexion of ankle reduces active insufficiency of Gastrocnemius, allowing it to assist Hamstrings in maintaining fixed knee flexion. See Knee flexion abduction force vector diagram. Adductor Magnus does not assist since hip extension does not occur in fully flexed position. Easier Movement can be made easier by lying closer under anchor of suspension trainer. Harder Movement can be made more challenging by lying further back, away horizontally from anchor of suspension trainer.",

"preparation": "Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until arms are extended forward and straight. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body reclines back behind suspension handles. Position body and legs straight at desired angle hanging from handles with arms straight. Balance on one leg with opposite leg extended straight forward as high as possible.",
"execution": "Squat down as far as possible while keeping leg elevated off of floor. Keep supporting knee pointed same direction as foot supporting. Raise body back, up to original position until knee and hip of supporting leg is straight. Repeat and continue with opposite leg.",
"comments": "Supporting knee should point same direction as foot throughout movement. Dismounting can be achieved by placing elevated leg down and walking backward until body is upright. This exercise can be performed on TRX style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings. Also known as Suspended Pistol Squat. Range of motion will be improved with greater leg strength and glute flexibility. Significant spinal flexion is acceptable form in full range single leg squat. Erector Spinae becomes a stabilizer if spine is kept straight. Unlike most suspension training exercises where movement is easier in a more upright position, suspension trainer single leg squats is actually harder in most upright position. See Gravity Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences resistance. Weighted versions of this exercise would normally be considered auxiliary in context of other basic exercises (ie Barbell Squat, Sled Leg Press). However, in context of suspension training, this exercise can be considered basic. Easier Movement is easier in a more reclined position. Single leg split squat, with or without suspension trainer can also be considered for an easier alternative exercise. Harder Resistance is greatest when body is positioned upright with bodys center of gravity over foot. Single leg squat can also be performed without suspension trainer, requiring more balance.",

"comments": "Keep torso upright during squat flexible hip flexors are important. Forward knee should point same direction as foot throughout movement. Exercise can be dismounted by lifting suspended rear foot from loop, allowing it to fall back while placing foot on floor. A training partner can assist with positioning of loop around rear foot. May also be referred to as Suspended Single Leg Split Squat or Suspended Bulgarian Squat. This exercise can be performed on TRX style suspension trainer. Weighted versions of this exercise would normally be considered auxiliary in context of other basic exercises (ie Barbell Squat, Sled Leg Press). However, in the context of suspension training only program, this exercise can be considered basic. Easier For those that lack sufficient leg strength, squat down part way as far as able. For those with inadequate balance, consider either placing foot on stationary object such as bench or placing hand on stationary object for support. Single Leg Split Squat (foot on bench) Harder Squatting down more deeply can make movement more difficult. Also consider Suspended Single Leg Squat as more difficult alternative exercise.",
