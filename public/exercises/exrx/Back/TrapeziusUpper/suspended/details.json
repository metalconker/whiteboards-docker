"force": "Pull",
"preparation": "Grasp gymnastics rings, one in each hand. Sit on mat between parallel bars. Kick legs up inverting and balancing body upside down.",
"execution": "Raise body up a high as possible by pulling shoulders toward ears. Lower body to original position and repeat.",
"comments": "Falling from an inverted position may result in very serious injury. To decrease potential of injury, position gymnastic rings over well padded surface, only high enough to allow full range of motion. Since this movement becomes more difficult as full shoulder elevation is achieved, height criteria for shoulder elevation may be needed. For example, raising shoulders until slope of shoulders becomes horizontal may be considered adequate, depending upon individual body structure and range of motion with lighter weight. Also see ROM Criteria. This exercise can be performed on adjustable length gymnastics rings or a dual anchored suspension trainer. Easier There are very few practical ways to make this exercise easier except placing lower legs on higher bar above. Feet may make contact with suspension trainer straps for more stability. See demonstration of Suspended Inverted Shrug with feet against straps. Harder For greater resistance, have partner stand off to side, hold weight on rear end. Only strongest individuals will be able to perform full rep(s) with exercise partner sitting on back of thighs seated in opposite direction.",
