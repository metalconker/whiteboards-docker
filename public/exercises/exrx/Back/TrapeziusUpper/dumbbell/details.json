"execution": "Elevate shoulders as high as possible. Lower and repeat.",
"comments": "Exercise may be performed standing perfectly upright or very slightly bent over. Since this movement becomes more difficult as full shoulder elevation is achieved, height criteria for shoulder elevation may be needed. For example, raising shoulders until slope of shoulders becomes horizontal may be considered adequate depending upon individual body structure and range of motion with lighter weight.
