Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or dont position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi, since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, grasp bar in standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension. A wide overhand grip involves overall back musculature while slightly emphasizing Rear Delt, Infraspinatus and Teres Minor involvement.",
