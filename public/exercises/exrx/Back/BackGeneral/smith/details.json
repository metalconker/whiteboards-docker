"force": "Pull",
"preparation": "Bend knees slightly and bend over bar with back straight. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip. Disengage bar by rotating bar back.",
"execution": "Pull bar to upper waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched downward. Repeat.",
"comments": "Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Platform (as shown) is only needed if smith machine does not allow bar to be lowered to lowest position. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility ). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.",
