"preparation": "Lay on back under fixed horizontal bar. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip. Place back of heels on elevated surface.",
"execution": "Keeping body straight, pull body up to bar. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched forward. Repeat.",
"comments": "Fixed bar should be just high enough to allow arm to fully extend. Placing back of heels on elevated surface is optional. This exercise is typically performed without added resistance, although a weight vest can be worn or additional weight can be placed on belly or pelvis. Partner can add and remove weight, and keep weight from sliding off belly. Resistance can be further reduced by performing movement from higher bar andor positioning heels on floor (see Inverted Row on high bar). See Gravity Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences resistance. Also known as Weighted Body Row or Weighted Supine Row.",
