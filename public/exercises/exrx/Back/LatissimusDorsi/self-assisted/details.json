"preparation": "Stand facing fixed horizontal bar at neck height. Grasp bar with underhand grip shoulder width. Position feet forward on floor, slightly in front of bar.",
"execution": "Lower body under bar until arms and shoulders are fully extended. If necessary, use minimal assistance of lower body to control descent, allowing knees and hips to bend, keeping flat on floor. Pull body up until elbows are to sides, again with minimal assistance from lower body. Repeat.",
"comments": "If lower body is used for assistance, Hip and Knee Extensors muscles are utilized. Back extensors may be activated minimally as stabilizer through spine. If bar is slightly higher, extend foot into floor at top of movement. Reposition foot flat on floor on initial descent. If foot extension is used to assist at top of movement on high bar, ankle and foot plantar flexor muscles are used. Easier Resistance can be reduced by pushing with legs more or using assisted machine. Assisted Machine Harder Standard Underhand Chinups or assisted Underhand Chinups with partner can be performed for greater challenge. ChinupPartner Assisted",
