"preparation": "Place cable belt or dip belt around waist. Kneel before low pulley and attach it to cable. Stand and position heels on forward edge of platform. Grasp support bar for balance.",
"execution": "Pull forefeet up toward body as far as possible. Return by extending feet until toes are pointed downward. Repeat.",
"comments": "A short chain may be used to add length to cable so belt can be more easily attached to cable as long as it is short enough to allow full range of motion. Calf block or exercise step that will not overturn can be used as platform. Keep knees and hips straight throughout exercise. The exercise can be made more difficult by positioning heels closer to edge of platform. See Dorsal Flexor Calf Exercise Analyses.",
