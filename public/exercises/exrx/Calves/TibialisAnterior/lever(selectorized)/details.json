"execution": "Pull forefoot up and toward body as far as possible. Return by extending feet until toes are pointed away from body. Repeat.",
"comments": "Often bending significantly at hips as shown in Sled Reverse Donkey Calf Raise typically reduces range of motion at ankle during dorsal flexion. Position torso more upright as shown, effectively reduces bend at hip. See Dorsal Flexor Calf Exercise Analyses.",

"comments": "Feet may be moved up higher on platform if bottom of forefoot can still contact platform with knees straight and back of hips can remain on back pad. The angle of back pad may be lowered back to keep back of hips on lower portion of back pad. Keep knees straight throughout exercise. Also see on alternative machine.
